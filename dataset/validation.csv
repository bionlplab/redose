I tried to quit a much more hardcore habit multiple times, but nothing worked until I came clean and told a few trusted loved ones and my therapist about what was going on.

If you're on more than 16mg a day for at least 10-14 days and also using H on top of that then I don't think you will feel much after you stop the H use just because you should have enough bupe on your receptors to not get any PWD's or WD's that are unmanageable. Because i believe thats the whole point of ""bernese"" method to get on subs is slowly have more and more bupe take over your receptors while the heroin or fentanyl slides off and then eventually gets blocked. If you're on a low dose of subs and never really established a good amount of time where you were taking at least 8mg a day for some days then you most likely still have heroin on your receptors and might feel a little shitty when you take a full dose of subs.

There's been days where I was sick, and just got on a bus or two, searched for tinfoil that people left behind, and got enough to get well. Rock fentanyl has not nearly flooded the market as much. Another thing, is blues vary wildly in strength imo. It's almost a self regulating process.

You will never not want it, the idea is to not get to the point of boredom or whatever to think about it. It is hard if your dealer is close or you know people using, so first step is to block your dealers numbers, your friends using, whomever can pull you in. You only cheat yourself so block who ever you need to, their opinion be damned (and bro, your best friend in drug use is not what you see when you are in recovery, you see all the little shit that happens, the way you manipulated people and they were pulling you along. Yea, you knew it all along, you just wanted to score, but you really get to think about it all, and no one using is going to be on the same level as someone trying to recover, period). Get off social media if you use it. Find a sober community and actually spend time there, if you are like me and do not like that route, expect many relapses unless you pour your soul into some form of reward, like work. It sucks we all felt that other side, and I still fuck up to this day, though using the suboxone program your fuck ups can be extremely far, from weeks to months to years. Let me put it like this bro, I was a heavy user for years and years and years and decades and decades. I have seen it all and been through it all. I know the feeling of wanting to stop and not being able to because of life, work, fuck im homeless, fuck I got all these charges, ect.. It sucks man, it does, I just passed up a dope deal today after sending myself into precip AT WORK! Man, you wanna know how slow time is? Jail time, Prison time, and precip at work time, big differences! So i got out TONIGHT hours ago and drove like a fucking mad man to my dealer, and I was driving and a part of me didn't want to keep going, but I pushed that insane shit aside and kept driving to see my dude.. Well, I  said forget it, TO HIS FACE and you know why? Cause I have been so long through the times I did shit, that normal life is actually more attractive, even over precip with my dealer in front of me. That is shit I could never do if it were not for the long times inbetween relapses that gave me a good life being sober. I hate to say get on the sub program, but effectivly use the community to stay sober for long enough periods that you will feel like I did today, saying no to a dealer in precip, a dealer I sought out and said ""fuck it, forget it"". Shits no joke man, I know whats up, and while I won't be sleeping tonight, I got the heart spaz shit still going, my pulse is crazy, the fever chills, all the bad shit, cant stand fucking stilll and the world has that fucked up ""bad"" vibe"" to it, I passed that shit up. The point is to do ANYTHING you can to get enough time under your belt so you remember what being normal was like. I have been normal probably 2 years in total time since I was 15, I am now 38, so 21 years on active duty to a drug I love and hate. If anything, I am fucking hurting here talking to you, so you won't be alone there if you are hurting too. It felt good to type this out, cause this shit sucks.

It doesn't. Now, the NALTREXONE (vivitrol, pills etc) is related to Naloxone but it IS active because it can be absorbed through the stomach and is much stronger. BUPRENORPHINE IS what causes the precipitated withdrawal in this case and it would not have mattered if it was Subutex or Suboxone.

Cps is just ONE example. A hospital calling cps ONLY because a mom is on Suboxone, that is discrimination by definition. People are bringing in examples of situations that wouldn't be discrimination and trying to manipulate my point. If the woman is on Suboxone and at any point in her 10 months of pregnancy, something she does is cause for concern, that is not what I'm talking about.

Especially when they're fucking with fentanyl rather than oxy. In my opinion you're not opioid tolerant until you've been taking over 80mg per day.. which is more than double your dose. And still.. compared to a lot of folks on here.. myself included.. even 80+ mg a day seems awful low. I'm currently on a dose of buprenorphine (24mg/day) that is supposedly equivalent to 6 oxy 80s a day. Which is a whole lot less than the 2-3 bundles of dope a day I was doing years ago.. but also 12 times more than the 40mg/day you're prescribed. That's why i really dislike the term ""opioid tolerant"". Depending who you're talking to what constitutes being opioid tolerant can vary greatly. It's not a badge of honor although I've seen many people treat it as such. I feel that telling a person they're tolerant at doses like yours can give a false sense of security in that it makes people think they can handle enormous doses of any opioid without worrying about potentially killing their self. There is a very large difference in potency when comparing oxy to fentanyl. You MUST be careful.

But we both decided that one more week would be better. After that he's doing the IOP. Unfortunately he has to go back to work full-time after an additional week off. He is the breadwinner and if he doesn't go back to work we lose our home. We are already in horrible financial condition. He does think going back to work will help him as he doesn't want to be sitting idly either. He really doesn't think he needs Suboxone but I think we're going to try and Naltrexone.

It‚Äôs better to take the loperamide before the wds start and yeah it‚Äôs like a handful, but it‚Äôs still safe. Loperamide got a really bad name because junkies were taking 100 plus pills over a long period of time in an attempt to get it to cross the blood brain barrier. This of course turned out to be very dangerous. But when used correctly it‚Äôs not dangerous and you aren‚Äôt exceeding the daily allotment that a crohns patient would take. Loperamide is derived from opiates.. we have receptors through out our bodies.. when you take enough lope.. it‚Äôs just enough to ding those receptors. I‚Äôd start with taking ten or 13 caplets daily for a week straight and then slowly stop taking them over the next week and a half. You‚Äôll sleep every night and be able to work. Drs have been so careless for years when it came to getting off subs.. often leaving people with options that are too expensive or no options at all.

,"(H, DRUG)",,"Even to this day (just turned 37), I feel like I'm not a mature, independent adult, because I didn't LIVE my formative young adult years. 18-26 were just a haze. I fucked myself over with H and may need therapy for the rest of my life."

,"(fent, DRUG), (subs, DRUG)",,"If you‚Äôre already on subs and do fent you‚Äôre fine to dose subs as usual. The only time it‚Äôs an issue is when you‚Äôre not already on subs and you‚Äôre trying to start them. Unless you go on like a multiple day bender, you‚Äôre good."

And within a single day taking shrooms I was able to hit 40 without any issues, and today hit 50 with 40 being no problem. I don't understand this either, all I know is my prior physical limits without shrooms, and my physical limits after shrooms and that the effects seem to last correlating with dose. Microdose 1 day after taking, small macrodose, 4 days, and 3g macrodose, still taking effect after almost a week."
,"(benzodiazepines, DRUG)",,There is a sub it‚Äôs benzodiazepines
,"(opioids, DRUG), (opiate, DRUG), (methadone, DRUG)",,"Yeah for sure! The research on opioids and low test levels have also found that the longer the half-life of the opiate used, the stronger negative impact it has on T; with methadone being the worst!"
,"(Heroin, DRUG), (acetylated codeine, DRUG)",,"I labor tested it, its 73% Heroin and some side products like acetylated codeine. Probably the euphoria wakes me up."
,"(sublocade, DRUg), (iv/im bupe, DRUG), (h, DRUG)",,Are you talking about sublocade or iv/im bupe? Because on sublocade it takes really strong h to feel anything and i barely felt the h via iv. It basically took craving away

"(4, DOSE), (20, DOSE)","(Heroin, DRUG), (Oxy, DRUG) ",,"Heroin and Oxy are not that different. Oxy used to be pharma, so obv cleaner, heroin needs more precaution measures like 22 micron syringe filters to get out the worst of the cut."
,"(kratom, DRUG), (poppy pod tea, DRUG), (dried poppy pods, DRUG)",,"Hard to say. I started taking kratom when I was 18 years old because I thought it was 100% safe. I started with just 4gs on the evening and it eventaully progressed to 20g daily. A few years in I realized that I live in a nation where poppy pod tea is legal and you can buy it freely on the internet, so I ordered that. I would say I took between 20 and 40g of dried poppy pods a day, but I always switched between tea and kratom every week so my tolerance wouldnt increase."

,"(oxy, DRUG), (subs, DRUG)",,Yeah you can get them from that short of a use if it‚Äôs stacked on your oxy use. I think using subs and done as a taper are hard and slippery. Foot in or out of the water not half way. Subs and done work great for MAT in my experience. Using them to avoid withdrawals never happened just prolonged it

"(8, DOSE), (1, DOSE)","(Wellbutrin, DRUG), (psilocybin, DRUG)",,"This is good to know. I enjoy being on Wellbutrin and was wondering if I had to be completely off of it. Unfortunately moat of the doctors in my area tend to be on the conservative side. The last time I asked, my doctor said there are groups in the area for people that suffer from addiction. Clearly not all medical professionals are up to date with the positive effects of psilocybin."
,"(Kratom, DRUG)",,"I had pills  and I just drew on them with a pen and chiseled off. A fast tap actually. Pill cutters can work ok. Some turns to dust and you just suck it off your finger. I didn‚Äôt have the films or whatever but there‚Äôs YouTube videos on how to do everything that would be better than me telling you. My doctor prescribed me 8mg a day for Kratom withdrawal which was totally excessive, 1mg kept withdrawals in check. I was just doing a quick taper"

,"(weed, DRUG), (cannabis, DRUG)",,"Guess I'll just stick with the weed. I just wish quality flower were more accessible we're I live. My country's laws regarding cannabis are as crappy as they can be. Inevitably, that makes us have to either plant at home, which is a liability on itself, pay a premium for a ridiculously low amount of weed, or smoke old, stinky, pressed, moldy and ammoniated shit."

,"(benzos, DRUG), (opiods, DRUG), (morphine, DRUG)",,"I have plenty of personal experience with both benzos and opioids, and both from my experience and from what I've heard from others, tolerance develops much faster to opioids, and opioids are also less sedative especially when you're not lying down. We know from the post that she has chronic pain and anxiety so she probably needs both. 60mg of oral morphine is actually a pretty low dose (if that's her daily total), because again, of how quickly tolerance develops to opioids. There's people on thousands of milligrams of morphine per day, and they're completely functional most of the time."
,"(fent, DRUG), (opiates, DRUG), (nitazenes, DRUG)",,Not sure but I do know that lots of shit off streets doesn't pop for fent or opiates.   Maybe nitazenes but that's just a guess.

It went basically something like: to drop from 40 mg, take 30mg for 3 days, then take 20mg for 4 days, then 10mg for 6 days, then stop.  LOL!!  I would be in the hospital or at least the psychiatric ward. That quick of a taper, especially for someone who‚Äôs been on an AD for years like me, is insane!"
,"(dope, DRUG)",,Then I was put back to weekly visits and then two weeks after a couple months. That‚Äôs the longest they prescribed while smoking dope. Right now I‚Äôve stopped treatment as I take the pills 8 mgs twice a day. But I was only taking about 5 mgs and saved a lot of them. So I‚Äôm taking it easy with the stash I‚Äôve got.

,"(methadone, DRUG)",,Maybe get on methadone? Youre so young.. You still have the rest of your life ahead of you. You definitely would need some medical supervision coming off a 3g a day habit. If you have rich parents you could do a rapid detox for like 20k.
,"(weed, DRUG), (shrooms, DRUG)",,"idk but someone told me when they smoke hella weed that music with a lot of thumping sounds, synth type sounds different and more liquid like. i think the neuroplasty buff from shrooms calms/removes things that get in the way of a neutral perception"

,"(Subs, DRUG), (sublocade, DRUG)",,Being clean from Subs is only a step in the right direction I'm we are also not using otherwise.  People have different reasons for not wanting to be on them but those are them used to justify not using MAT. And often the reason is solely because it takes away the  option of getting high for an entire month in the case of sublocade injections.

Stay away from the benadryls and allergy meds."

,"(fent, DRUG), (heroin, DRUG)",,Fuck shooting up. Those are the kind of people that gives fent and heroin a bad rap.
,"(methadone, DRUG)",,I would say your post is the most honest and accurate advice you could give OP. Thanks from myself as I‚Äôm on methadone. It‚Äôs been a life saver. I‚Äôm just feeling like I gotta get off sooner or later. My surgeon/pain dr just recently said why are you even thinking of getting off? He was basically saying to stop thinking that way. WTF?! It‚Äôs been 2 years. Im only taking methadone. No cravings. No nothing. I even quit smoking. I get 2 weeks carrys and if I wanted a month I could have it too. I dunno. Im confused as hell.
,"(SSRIS, DRUG), (shrooms, DRUG), (acid, DRUG), (amphetamines, DRUG)",,"Do you take SSRIs? I have a very similar problem, where shrooms, acid, and amphetamines don't do anything at all for me. I believe SSRIs block certain receptors in your brain so you can't get high from certain drugs (forgive my informal language I'm not 100% informed on all the details)."
,"(H, DRUG)",,"Cheers to having fun, i'm about to inject some more. Btw what color is your H?"
,"(oxy, DRUG)",,Straight oxy is much healthier. Look up CWE like the other person said.
,"(subs, DRUG)",,how many mg of subs have you been taking daily on top of using ?
,"(suboxone, DRUG) ",,"I am in NJ. I have been using quickmd for two months and filling at CVS with no issue. I do have  5+ year history filling suboxone at CVS, so not sure if that helped me as well."

,"(Suboxone, DRUG), ",,"Yaaaaaaa. A quick skim says you‚Äôre on Suboxone, Adderall, meth of some sort to be having sex on it, and have every lettered mental disorder possible. And you wonder why CPS is knocking."
,"(Xanax, DRUG), (Suboxone, DRUG)",,Because both work on your central nervous system the Xanax and the Suboxone both do the same thing so while it may seem like the Xanax is stronger in reality your just feeling the effects of both the subs and xans at the same time
,"(fent, DRUG)",,"some people just dont have the constitution. I used to be able to kick it cold turkey but after fent became the main ingredient in what i thought was my drug of choice, i just could not handle the withdrawals without help. It is what it is"
,"(acute WDs, EFFECT), (DOC, DRUG)",,Also interestingly enough  dose is not only what matters when it comes to acute WDs. How much the dose affects you may also need to be considered as well as how long DOC has been used.
,"(pot, DRUG), (alcohol, DRUG)",,It‚Äôs great.  I quit everything except pot after a while microdosing. (Coffee and alcohol‚Ä¶. just to clarify).
"(.5, DOSE)","(kratom, DRUG)",,You can try it but kratom doesn‚Äôt help much with the withdrawal in my experience. May help make you a bit more comfortable
,"(sub, DRUG)",,Damn buddy sorry to hear that. This is why I don't tell people to dose sub until it's safe. Why didn't you just do the .5mg max like I suggested just to see if it could help get you through some of the waiting for a bigger dose?
"(11, DOSE)","(heroin, DRUG), (opiates, DRUG)",,The withdrawal from this stuff is worse then Heroin/Opiates. You just have to slowly take less and less until your body needs none.
,"(#4, DRUG), (Fent, DRUG)",,What‚Äôs that say? 11 grams? What a chunk man. Is this #4? Fent or no?
,"(2map, DRUG)",,I've dabbled in 2map quite a bit.  From my understanding there was a very bad batch of it a few years ago and this is where most of the horror stories about its causticity originate.  Since the vast majority of the supply probably originates from just a few labs if you were using at this time you likely got hit with it.  Luckily I didn't use it until comfortably after that and I've never felt like it was any harder on my body than anything else I've done.
,"(h, DRUG), (tar, DRUG)",,Good ol pure h not tar bull shit and cane was the best ever. Boy oh boy do I miss my boi.
,"(nicotine, DRUG), (nic, DRUG)",,What dose of nicotine are you using? bcuz I've been vaping for some years 24/7 and if I skipped days it was not a problem.. I didn't get any withdrawals.. but after some years it wasn't fun anymore because my tolerance was too high so I'm only vaping like twice a week now so I get the nic flash again..

,"(oxy, DRUG), (morphine, DRUG)",,40mg oxy equals 60mg morphine
,"(sublocade, DRUG), (suboxone, DRUG)",,"If his dental health is important to you both (not knocking that) they do in fact have sublocade shots. From my understanding, it‚Äôs the same as taking suboxone but it‚Äôs a monthly injection so you don‚Äôt need to think about taking it everyday (which in my opinion the daily ingestion of a drug, whether it affects my mood or not, can be a trigger for me)."
,"(clonidine, DRUG)",,"Taper off slowly, it'll make the withdrawal more tolerable. Lower the amount your doing as well as increase the # of hours in between doses. I highly recommend getting a prescription of clonidine."
,"(bupe, DRUG), (opioids, DRUG)",,"So in one state, that's 10 deaths in 4 years with only bupe on board but I do wonder then if some of those people had depressed respiration from some other cause and bupe pushed them over the edge, or a similar scenario. It doesn't depress your breathing anywhere near what other opioids do. It also seemed to me that Tennessee made it a point to go looking in other years to reach a conclusion."
,"(Xylazine, DRUG)",,Xylazine! Horrible.
,"(subs, DRUG)",,You‚Äôll get there. Stay with the subs as long as you need to.

Physical WD disappeared after about day 7 but I have a Gastroscopy this Saturday under sedation and I am unsure as to wether they will give me Midazolam + Fentanyl or Midazolam alone. My doctors are aware I‚Äôm in recovery and the procedure is urgent but I will clarify this on the morning of the procedure. How are you ?
"(6, DOSE)","(heroin, DRUG), (antidepressants, DRUG)",,"So my sister put it out there that maybe all addicts are to some extent Neuro divergent. When you are, things like depression are caused by a lack of dopamine instead of lack of serotonin or norepinephrine. I feel normal on heroin. More normal than I ever did without it. But I don't know of any antidepressants that are selective dopamine reuptake inhibitors..."
,"(withdrawal, EFFECT)",,Imho you can go instantly to 6mg without any withdrawal Symptoms.

And killed my cousin after the heroin....fentanyl consumed him... I saved his life 7-8 times, it was such a trauama..... But I'll quit rambling."
,"(suboxone, DRUG), (hydromorphone, DRUG), (dilaudid, DRUG)",,"I have had a major surgery and was on 24mg of suboxone daily. I had to be given a lot of hydromorphone and even though I had to be given high doses, it did the job to help with the pain. But the important part was my anesthesiologist knew what to do with patients who take suboxone. You only take 8mg a day, so finding the right hydromorphone dose for you shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. Now when you get off hydromorphone to get back on suboxone, wait at least 6 hours between the last dose of dilaudid before going back to your suboxone. Good luck."

,"(opiates, DRUG), (nauseous, EFFECT)",,I recommend eating on opiates so you‚Äôd not get nauseous asf. I learned this shit finally after years of use even after a tolerance build up you still got to eat
,"(opiates, DRUG)",,"He should have some kind of tools to analyze what he's trying to escape from. People who are happy with themselves don't take opiates. It's a sign of poor coping skills or self loathing or depression or some such. Every addict is different. It's just that we gotta understand why we are using and then when that why happens, what to do about it. It's fucking impossibly hard."
,"(Suboxone, DRUG)",,"It's still not gonna be simple. The biggest problem still remains, and that is not enough psychiatric providers accepting insurance for Suboxone patients. In a lot of places it's cash only. And that's costing lives."
,"(opiates, DRUG) ",,No problem bro. Tell you what.. if you're in the states there's a way you can get into rehab without having to wait. Just show up there under the influence. They can't turn you away. Doesn't even have to be opiates either. You can show up drunk and they have to take you in. I learned that after calling every drug rehab within 50 miles of where I lived and kept being told they were full. So I went to the emergency room at the closest hospital..  guy there told me how to bypass the wait.. and he was absolutely right. Shit worked every time. Too bad the rehabs didn't.  But if you're stuck waiting and don't want to wait.. it never fails. You're guaranteed to get in immediately.

,"(WD, EFFECT), (opioids, DRUG)",,"It‚Äôs very weird. My theory is my inhibitory system kicked back in after being over stimulated during WD as the opioids weren‚Äôt artificially inhibiting me anymore. Unless the opioids damages my thyroid- I should probably check that but I‚Äôm worried about losing my job, so conserving as much money as I can before in case my productivity doesn‚Äôt improve - with job cuts it‚Äôs poor timing being a non-performer ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
,"(Subutext, DRUG), (bupe, DRUG)",,Subutext is straight bupe
,"(perc 30, DRUG), (fent, DRUG)",,"I think everyone knows that, saying perc 30 is like saying dirty 30. It refers to it being a fake, most often fent laced pill. Its obvious thats what OP meant since he mentioned a dirty 30 before using the synonymous ""perc 30"". You seem to be the one outta the loop here"
,"(HHC, DRUG), (HHCP, DRUG), (weed, DRUG), (Bloodshot eyes, EFFECT)",,"I smoke HHC+HHCP in a disposable vape pen and it's great. I didn't even find weed appealing. It has a fast comeup, faster than 10 mins, I don't know how real thing feels because never managed to get out anything of it in any form, but god, 2-4 deep inhales/draws that are at least 5 second long and holding for 6-7 seconds the vape and you're blasted. Bloodshot eyes, you seem badly baked even to the people who can't recognize a stoner. For first time I felt what weed feels like and why people suggest weed when WDing."

,"(H, DRUG), (fent, DRUG), (agmatine, DRUG), (BulkSupplements, DRUG)",,I order offline but you could find it at like GNC or a vitamin store. It might take longer than I said but I had good success tapering my H dose (fent free) with agmatine before quitting (it seriously helps withdrawals too!).

,"(MS Contin, DRUG), (enjoyable, EFFECT), (heroin, DRUG)",,I had a few months where a doctor prescribed me 100 mg MS Contin 2x/day. I always just doubled up my dosage and took 2 in the AM. I found it quite enjoyable; definitely not as good as heroin but it did nicely in a pinch while I was dealing with some medical issues & copping wasn‚Äôt an easy option.

,"(SSRIs, DRUG), (SNRIs, DRUG)",,"Other SSRIs/SNRIs would inhibit the enzyme even more, but there's also lots of person to person variation in the activity of these enzymes, so maybe you didn't need much change from your baseline levels to really stop you from having strong effects."

I fucking hate opiates"
"(10, DOSE), (15, DOSE), (20, DOSE), (30, DOSE)","(fetty pills, DRUG)",,"Reading this hurts man I‚Äôm hitting my eighth day from fetty pills after using for a year straight everyday. At some point of your life you need to stop the pills. Bc not only are they slowly killing you, they are ruining your family. Your supposed to bury your parents not your parents bury you. Addiction is hard trust me I couldn‚Äôt see a day when I was sober but here I am now feeling better then ever with no intentions to pick up or even use again bc I know what road that leads down too. If I were you I would start by maybe tampering down how much you do? Try breaking it to quarters and only using when you really need too. But the sad reality is no one knows how much is in these fetty pills. I would buy all the medication to prepare you for the withdrawals and just strap on the ride and face your demons like a man. I know it‚Äôs hard trust me but I swear it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm living proof."

,"(alcohol, DRUG)",,Coffee & alcohol for me ‚úåÔ∏è
,"(Xans, DRUG), (H, DRUG)",,Xans and H will definitely kill you gangsta be safe
,"(weed, DRUG)",,"I smoked plastic bic sharpie lids with water bottle for weed,glass being different but find ideal equipment before any research"
,"(Fent, DRUG)",,Also in MA I was getting out just as Fent was coming in. Glad I did all my friends have ODed and died since on that shit. Be careful
,"(WD, EFFECT)",,May I ask when you get your shot next? I‚Äôm on the shot too and starting to feel WD symptoms tho not sure if it‚Äôs in my head or not. I don‚Äôt get my shot until the 17h tho. I really don‚Äôt wanna be miserable that long. Maybe I‚Äôll wait a week to call.
"(20, DOSE)","(on a fly, EFFECT), (acid, DRUG)",,"Hahahahahah! That's great! Oh to be a fly on that wall! I love the things diff stuff can do to all kinds of people. On acid, I clean. Nothing fun, just like a spring clean but an acid clean. I'm trying to cut down drug use but I tell you one thing for sure people who do not do drugs, recreational or a little more, do not have the same kinda fun stories we have! Boring !"
,"(morphine, DRUG), (antihistamines, DRUG)",,"I'm not thinking about taking morphine every weekend. I'm thinking at least 2 week pauses, if not longer. 20mg pills tops, orally, weed oil and antihistamines as potentiators. That's all. I just wanna know if that pattern of consumption is still prone to addiction and withdrawal or if I'm safe to recreationally consume in this regimen."
"(2, DOSE)","(coke, DRUG), (dope, DRUG)",,I shoot coke cause I like it. I shoot dope cause I need it.
,"(PWD, EFFECT)",,"I was terrified to take the sub for that exact reason of PWD! When I got to 2 mg I was waiting for it but it never came, I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that. Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself, you got this. One day at a time. Shouldn‚Äôt you be okay to take some after 3 days? I‚Äôd recommend the Bernese method that‚Äôs what I did! Microdosing spared me that hell I am grateful"
,"(opiates, DRUG), (weed, DRUG), (cocaine, DRUG)",,Most people who stay clean have a recovery support system. Meetings is most common. AA is better than NA because they talk about the disease of addiction not about opiate use specifically. To say meetings trigger him but drinking and smoking weed still have a place in his life is not taking his recovery seriously at all. He should have SOMETHING to work with for his recovery support system. He needs other addicts. People who will tell him that using cocaine is guaranteed to be a bad idea. That having it in your head that opiate use is ok if it's some far away date and in Amsterdam is what's known as a reservation and may mean you are not going to be able to stay clean. Just you two dealing with this alone seems risky. Have a plan set up for his recovery before the recreational shit leads to a problem. And hey. Why not try not doing anything recreational? It's not a good start
,"(subs, DRUG), (methadone, DRUG), (levomethadone, DRUG)",,"Idc if you're on subs, methadone, levomethadone, or even on pain management but not getting high. You're ""clean"" if you aren't abusing drugs."
,"(fent, DRUG)",,Nice. I‚Äôm from little village. There‚Äôs only fent around my way.
"(3000, DOSE)","(heroin, DRUG), (infections, EFFECT), (diseases, EFFECT)",,"IVing street drugs is a sure ticket to infections and diseases, for obvious reasons. It's not the heroin itself."

,"(fentanyl, DRUG), (dope, DRUG), (painful, EFFECT)",,"I mean it‚Äôs possible your old plugs dope still has fentanyl in it, which makes withdrawals particularly painful. It‚Äôs really rare to find dope on the street that doesn‚Äôt have fentanyl present day."
"(12, DOSE)","(subs, DRUG), (PWD, EFFECT)",,"Some people can and some can until they can't. I thought I was clever and beating the addiction and just getting high a couple of times once or twice a week, then hopping back on my subs before they left my system and would put me into PWD."
,"(subutex, DRUG), (buprenorphine, DRUG), (naloxone, DRUG), (suboxone, DRUG) ",,"Huh‚Ä¶ subutex doesn‚Äôt come in a 12mg tablet, however buprenorphine and naloxone (suboxone) does have a 12mg dosage in strips‚Ä¶"
"(300, DOSE)","(fent, DRUG), (fentanyl, DRUG), (heroin, DRUG), (morphine, DRUG)",,"so just wanna say, just because your fent test(which i hope you used more than one) came back negative, there are a LOT of RC(research chemicals) out there in the world that mimic heroin/morphine and others, that aren‚Äôt fentanyl."
,"(Cymbalta, DRUG), (mushroom capsules, DRUG)",,I'm currently trying this now. Weaning off of Cymbalta while microdosing 300mg mushroom capsules. I microdose every three days. I also am planning on trying a big dose one day.
,"(antibiotics, DRUG)",,"You can forgo the bandage and get the antibiotics but because of the rot/necrotic flesh , that would will be deep and take a long time to heal.  Even with antibiotics.   Please do something though!"
,"(methadone, DRUG)",,"A few years ago I got into an accident. I fell off a tree top thing pretty high up. I had messed up my back. Also, I tore some type of ligament or muscle in my leg. I really should have had surgery to fix my leg issue, but I don‚Äôt have insurance and it would‚Äôve been too costly out-of-pocket. I also have previous back issues from another problem a while back. I work in transportation so usually I sit in the car for about 12 hours a day, which is very bad on my back and my leg. I was going to the doctor about all I want to give is tramadol and that doesn‚Äôt help my problem. So I‚Äôve been buying stuff off the street which is dangerous and way too expensive. So now I have something that can take away my chronic pain problems and is cheaper than my habit, which eventually will cost me more money because my tolerance is going up. I was just making a point of asking what the conversion rate was because I was OK on 30 but 40 was a little too strong so it‚Äôs better. I‚Äôm on the methadone program versus buying shit off the street which is no good."
