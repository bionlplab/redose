When I started injecting into the groin (with extreme caution), I had no more problems, as the femoral vein is very large and resilient. I don't feel right about suggesting it, but if the only other option is you digging around in veins that need to be left alone, possibly giving yourself a nasty infection, or even blood poisoning, then I will say that you need to consider other options.

Maybe 10%, so maybe .1g is actually 10mg of H and 90% bash. What im trying to say, is it's hard to say what your dose would be - even without tolerance, you might be naturally tolerant for example.. I'd say just go easy, smoke it slowly and see how you feel and then you'll know based on your own experience.. with low tolerance, even small hits should still get you high even if they don't make you nod. You can't really snort UK H though, so you'll need to either smoke it or inject it - Id say smoke it if you've never injected a drug before though, as newbies to IV H can get super high from super small amounts. I had a 240mg 3x daily oxy habit (snorted) when I switched to H, and I was getting 3 IV hits from .1G (100mg in weight, how much was actually heroin is beyond knowledge) though now, even with sporadic use and being on a low dose of methadone (30mg, which should keep my tolerance quite low - it doesn't even hold me really but my clinic refuses to increase me unless I give clean piss tests, which is ass backwards as I have chronic pain and that's why I got addicted to H, ever used it to begin with, and why I give dirty tests - I can only go a short while between attacks of my condition, so even if I'm not using daily, I can't get long enough between piss tests without using for pain - the easy solution would be increase my methadone which would ease some of my pain (along with stopping me from withdrawing slightly anyway while on the dose and needing to rush chemist for the next dose soon as I wake up in the morning while puking due to a mix of my debilitating gastroparesis and withdrawals.

First of all I'm sorry that you're going through that. You need to look up buprenorphine bioavailability. You will see that the different routes of administration have different bioavailability factors. That being said unless you feel like mainlining it which I wouldn't suggest: your best bet is if it's a pill crush it up and sniff a quarter. If it's film cut a quarter of a piece off take a toothpaste cap put it in the toothpaste cab put warm water in it or hot water and kind of stir it up and once it dissolves sniff it up your nose. You will get 69% right off the bat as opposed to sublingually you're going to get anywhere from 13% to 69%. I've been taking this stuff since 2002. It's an extremely strong drug milligram for milligram you're going to be all right!

Nope. The method of mortality your attributing to alcohol and benzos is incorrect which is probs why you think it‚Äôs the same as opiates. Alocohol and benzos are the only withdrawals that can actually kill you from the withdrawal itself. They can both cause status epilepticus. The nervous system is operating at such high levels that you enter a seizure state that can‚Äôt break and you repeatedly seize till you die. Nothing can stop it (like it‚Äôs treatable sometimes but you can‚Äôt prevent it from happening). Technically you could die from opiate withdrawal if you didn‚Äôt drink enough water and had bad diahhrea but the death would be dehydration. And it would have been preventable with appropriate care. Whereas S.E. Is not. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs different.  Like you said yourself. For opiate withdrawals it isn‚Äôt the withdrawals it‚Äôs from a prticular effect of the withdrawals combined with poor care like dehydration. Whereas status epilepticus is literally death by withdrawal.,"[('alcohol', 'DRUG'), ('benzos', 'DRUG'), ('opiates', 'DRUG'), ('Alocohol', 'DRUG'), ('benzos', 'DRUG'), ('status', 'EFFECT'), ('seize', 'EFFECT'), ('opiate', 'DRUG'), ('bad', 'EFFECT'), ('dehydration', 'EFFECT'), ('opiate', 'EFFECT'), ('status', 'EFFECT')]"

The only legal thing I know can help if you don‚Äôt have subs is ZaZa. You can get it at smoke shops. Just to give you a back up plan. Or Pegasus. They are both capsules.

Only getting up to use the bathroom, drink mad fucken water mixed with Pedialyte, and maybe smoke some pot, or eat a piece of toast with weed butter, and then knock back out.

Even b4 the purple garbage reared it's ugly head there was stuff going around that was like you bang it and you wake up on the floor three hours later. No high, no nothing. In fact one bag would last damn near a whole day but it's garbage. The PCP is most alarming bc I used to smoke that once in a while a long time ago.

The first you couldn't really tell unless you tested with the free test strips they give. Then it was looking like confectionate sugar. I can't believe people were even buying it, but they do. I did a harm reduction ""test"" as the location kept track when those reports and photos came out of the Midwest.

I have often smoked crack while withdrawing and while it can create some existential dread once coming down, it distracts and makes an hour or so go by much quicker while I also ruminate on things other than my withdrawals. I also completely disagree with the all or nothing approach to recovery, I‚Äôve successfully tapered off a dozen times only when I don‚Äôt completely restrict myself from any drug.

It took a very very long time to find a doctor that will work with me . Was in unbearable pain for nearly 2 years straight and then around 4-5 months ago I finally got a doctor that works with me . Took a few months to figure out what works but I think this new Percocet script should be just enough to keep me out of moderate to severe pain since I am constantly in either one of those pain levels . Don‚Äôt give up if you have serious chronic pain just do what you are supposed to do and don‚Äôt risk it over somthing small . Be honest with your doc about the effectiveness of the medication and i found even admitting that I use a tiny bit more than what‚Äôs on the bottle (occasionally) the honesty goes a long way but I can‚Äôt speak for other docs . Hope everyone stays safe and can be as close to pain free as possible","[('dirty', 'DRUG'), ('nucynta', 'DRUG'), ('opioid', 'DRUG'), ('Percocet', 'DRUG'), ('klonopin', 'DRUG'), ('Xanax', 'DRUG'), ('xans', 'DRUG'), ('lyrica', 'DRUG'), ('pregabalin', 'DRUG'), ('tizanidine', 'DRUG'), ('ambien', 'DRUG'), ('xans', 'DRUG'), ('ambien', 'DRUG'), ('Percocet', 'DRUG')]"

I was using about a gram per day.   In the end it doesn't matter quite as much as you might think.

"The supply does run low here in Aus, it's hard to get it here and even when they do we have some of the strictest border controls in the world, so it's not that easy to bring it into Aus, that's why the price is high aswell, because for every shipment that gets through one gets busted, so effectively the price is double what they actually pay before it's even got to them.. And we Aussies don't like replacements all that much, we get methadone and Buprenorphine for FREE from clinics so we never really have to hang out, if you can't get any tear the replacements are easy enough to get.. Australia also has alot of poppies growing, we are the biggest legal producer of medical grade opium in the world so we could always get a few poppy heads and make poppy tea or straight up smoke the opium latex but we just love out diamorphine and really nothing else will do the job, nothing else is the same, yeh will stop you being sick but it ain't gona get you a good high, possibly a shit high feeling but not a good H high..

I agree with you. It's important to figure out exactly why you choose to use drugs in order to prevent it from happening again. Or at least to mitigate the harm.

Yes its true that opiates will make you less motivated to engage in activities that you previously enjoyed. They bring no joy and seem boring esp if you are regularly taking enough opiates to nod off or you have just stopped using and you're in that state of discontent post withdrawal. But it's complicated isn't it? Fall in love or have a baby and you'll be flooded with oxytocin and then things you used to love doing (like clubbing or hanging out with friends) aren't so appealing. I think being on opiates makes you feel less joy but more calm/bliss. Then when you start to hang out or come off opiates you feel a range of more intense feelings - you can feel less comfortable but more alive. I think if you are an anxious person you might prefer the calm bliss of opiates to the intense aliveness of no opiates. And if the activities you used to enjoy don't engage you anymore you might need to find new activities to stimulate you. Think outside the box a bit.,"[('opiates', 'DRUG'), ('opiates', 'DRUG'), ('oxytocin', 'DRUG'), ('opiates', 'DRUG'), ('opiates', 'DRUG'), ('opiates', 'DRUG'), ('opiates', 'DRUG')]"

"What‚Äôs interesting about her is she‚Äôs always been one of those people that can really handle pain. She had a major car accident when she was younger and barely took meds.

We talked about it after my dad died and she was okay for a while. I am frustrated with her doctor because at the point when her back pain needed more than percocets I wish she‚Äôd stopped prescribing, instead she graduated to MS Contin which resulted in my mom losing her job and basically withdrawing from everyone. That only came to light when she got in a minor fender bender and ems couldn‚Äôt figure out why she was so altered.

This whole last year I have been noticing the same behaviors, being tired all the time, repeating herself constantly on phone calls, not remembering we had phone calls.

"As for pain relief, have you tried cannabis? You can buy delta 8 legally in most states (maybe all? I don‚Äôt know.) But I‚Äôve purchased it in four different states. It helped me to stop relying on pills as I had the same problem where doctors just refused to give me anything that helped ease the pain. I even had to go to the ER one night because I was in so much pain, I couldn‚Äôt stand it. I was literally crying I was hurting so bad. Doctor at the ER gave me gabapentin. I may as well have been given tic tacs. I literally went home and got drunk. It‚Äôs all I had that would give me any relief. When I saw my regular doctor a few days later, he asked f the gabapentin helped. I said it was the same garbage that it was when he gave it to me. He said ‚Äúso what did you do for the pain?‚Äù I was honest‚Ä¶said ‚ÄúI got hammered doc.‚Äù He was not happy about that. Gave me a lecture about it. I asked him ‚Äúwhat would you do if you were in so much pain, you were literally in tears and no one would give you anything to even ease the pain?‚Äù He actually said that if I would lose a little weight, the pain would be better. I was like, ‚Äúyeah no shit‚Ä¶I used to be a marathon runner and martial artist. I know about staying fit. But when you can‚Äôt walk unassisted, it‚Äôs hard to stay fit.‚Äù Eventually I gave up on doctors. They‚Äôre all in CYA mode and they don‚Äôt give a shit. I had a nightstand drawer filled with prescriptions. In one day, I dumped every bottle in the trash and bought a few ounces of delta 8.

"It's a terrible feeling of extreme chills and just overall feeling horrible. I know what you mean by lack of buzz feeling, but it's not that. I'm currently trying the ""less is more"" approach. Yesterday I tried to take 4mg, but felt horrible, so I ended up taking the other 4mg. I felt withdrawal all day, but it could have been because I had taken so much the day before. It tends to get much better taking 8mg after the tenth day, but I always end up screwing myself and taking more, then I have to start all over again. I've decided I will try 6mg for ten days and see how I feel. The problem is when I feel horrible my mind tells me to take more because occasionally it actually does make me feel better, but that is very rare. I've been trying all sorts of things for years. This all started when I went from 4mg to 8mg and above, so my best bet at feeling better is to probably go back to what worked in the first place. The problem with that though is my body is also used to a higher dose now, so I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. At least taking less will eventually work. I just have to deal with the sickness for a week, but hell I'm always sick anyways. It's just a matter of will power.

I almost gave in and took a tiny amount the other day just to get some relief but I‚Äôm doing good so far not to give in because I know it‚Äôll just prolong everything. I‚Äôm hoping after the 2nd week that things get a little better and I feel emotionally like myself everyday that passes.
